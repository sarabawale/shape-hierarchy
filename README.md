# Shape Hierarchy and Categorization

One Paragraph of the project description

This was the final project for our Machine Learning class.

See the <a href="http://2dshapesstructure.github.io">original project website</a> for a more comprehensive overview of the research study.

## Getting Started

Directory Structure:

  * clusters
    * ... # random samples from each cluster  
  * images
    * ... # each annotation from random samples from each cluster
  * JSON
    * ... # JSON shape files
  * our_clusters
    * ... # example clusters
  * annotationTable.csv
  * dataset.mat
  * displayShape.m
  * extractFeatures.m
  * featureData.mat
  * readJSON.m
  * runMe.m

### Prerequisites
 
* MATLAB R2018b or later

## Running the program

Run the runMe.m file and wait for results. The amount of clusters is currently set to 5, but this can be changed to any number up to 9.

Expected output: the MATLAB console will display model parameters and cluster data.

*There are NO popup figures; we suppressed the popups because of the size of the dataset, but the PNG files will be created inside the appropriate folders for viewing later*

Data files: dataset.mat, annotationTable.csv
MATLAB function to run: runMe.m

### Example console output

```
>> runMe
    Building k-means clustering model. Please hold, this will take a while...
    Parameters: k = 4, repetitions = 10, samples = 49, max iterations: 100

    Replicate 1, 66 iterations, total sum of distances = 2991.77.
    Replicate 2, 76 iterations, total sum of distances = 2991.77.
    Replicate 3, 68 iterations, total sum of distances = 2991.78.
    Replicate 4, 54 iterations, total sum of distances = 2991.77.
    Replicate 5, 71 iterations, total sum of distances = 2991.77.
    Replicate 6, 28 iterations, total sum of distances = 2991.78.
    Replicate 7, 86 iterations, total sum of distances = 2991.78.
    Replicate 8, 21 iterations, total sum of distances = 3400.97.
    Replicate 9, 53 iterations, total sum of distances = 2991.78.
    Replicate 10, 78 iterations, total sum of distances = 2991.78.
    Best total sum of distances = 2991.77
